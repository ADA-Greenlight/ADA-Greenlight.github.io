### Treatment and Control Matching:

# Replication of the paper's matching :

Based on the four variables below, minimise the L-infinite distance to match the pairs of control and treatment data points.

L-infinite distance = maximum of the absolute value of differences between the following four variables for each pair of treatment and control blocks :
* C_blocksdirtfloor : Proportion blocks of houses with 1+ houses that has dirt floors
* C_HHdirtfloor : Proportion of households with dirt floors
* C_child05 : Average number of children between 0-5 yrs
* C_households : Number of households

Compute the L-infinite distance between each possible pair of treated and control data points.
