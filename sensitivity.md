In treatment-control pairs matched for x i , the chance that the first person
in pair p is treated is θ p = 1 / 2 under the assumption that treatment assign-
ment is ignorable. What if that assumption is wrong?

By how much would θ p have to depart from 0.5 to obtain a P-value above 0.05 so that we can no longer reject the hypothesis of no effect?
